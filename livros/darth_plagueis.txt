0;Darth Plagueis the Wise;"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?"
1;Darth Plagueis the Wise;"No."
2;Darth Plagueis the Wise;"I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis... was a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise, he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians... to create... life. He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about... from dying."
3;Darth Plagueis the Wise;"He could actually... save people from death?"
4;Darth Plagueis the Wise;"The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities... some consider to be unnatural."
5;Darth Plagueis the Wise;"Whâ€“ What happened to him?"
6;Darth Plagueis the Wise;"He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was... losing his power. Which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew. Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."
7;Darth Plagueis the Wise;"Is it possible to learn this power?"
8;Darth Plagueis the Wise;"Not from a Jedi."
